Stack is a linear data structure whereas Heap is a hierarchical data structure. 
Stack memory will never become fragmented whereas Heap memory can become fragmented as blocks of memory are first allocated and then freed. 
Stack accesses local variables only while Heap allows you to access variables globally



Parameter-                              	Stack                                                                        	Heap

Type of data structures-	   A stack is a linear data structure.                                           Heap is a hierarchical data structure.

Access speed-	                   High-speed access           	                                                 Slower compared to stack

Space management-                  Space managed efficiently by OS so memory will never become fragmented.	Heap Space not used as efficiently. Memory can become fragmented as blocks of memory first allocated and then freed.

Access-	                           Local variables only	                                                        It allows you to access variables globally.                

Limit of space size-	           Limit on stack size dependent on OS.	                                        Does not have a specific limit on memory size.

Resize-	                           Variables cannot be resized	                                                Variables can be resized.

Memory Allocation-	           Memory is allocated in a contiguous block.	                                Memory is allocated in any random order.

Allocation and Deallocation-	   Automatically done by compiler instructions.	                                It is manually done by the programmer.

Deallocation-	                   Does not require to de-allocate variables.	                                 Explicit de-allocation is needed.

Cost-	                           Less	                                                                         More

Implementation-	                   A stack can be implemented in 3 ways simple array based, using dynamic memory,       Heap can be implemented using array and trees.
                                   and Linked list based.	


Main Issue-	                  Shortage of memory	                                                         Memory fragmentation

Locality of reference-	          Automatic compile time instructions.	                                         Adequate

Flexibility-	                  Fixed size	                                                                 Resizing is possible

Access time-	                  Faster	                                                                 Slower
